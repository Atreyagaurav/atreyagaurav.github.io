* Welcome to my page

Hi there.

I'm a Linux Enthusiast, so I write a lot of scripts or codes for personal linux tools, and I write some for emacs.

My research area is Hydrology/Hydraulics. I'd be happy to collaborate on things related to those.

My hobbies include anime and light novels, so I sometimes contribute to fan translations by making scripts or proof reading. Or very rarely trying to translate using meager japanese that I know (and lots of jisho/deepl).

You can reach me in discord, my username is: thevoidzero#４６８６ (type it out, don't copy it)

* Websites
I don't have many websites at this moment, I don't like web dev that much because I find it harder than making software tools. But since web apps are lot easier to use and easier to update after distribution I do make some. But unfortunately I haven't made anything that has lots of users/visitors.

** Kabita Check
Link: https://kabita-check.herokuapp.com

It is a website to check the chanda kabita (Poem) in Nepali Language. I made this for my father to check for any typographical mistakes he may have in his poems. It also has a Nepali Dictionary though with additional features of being able to search through the rhymes and tones.

** Onegai Translations
Link: http://onegai-translations.tech/home

It is currently under developement, the plan is to make a platform where translations can be done by the translators while the users can also read the content in both languages line by line. The website is intended to be used by language learners who are interested in literatures.

Due to my lack of skill in web dev, the website is just a skeleton for now. I do have a local copy with backend but I don't yet know the proper way to host it.

And because of lack of skill I've made a [[https://github.com/Atreyagaurav/onegai][commandline tool]] in Rust for some translation works. 

* General Programs
Here are some of the programs I am proud of. 

All of these programs are on my [[https://github.com/Atreyagaurav][github]] account, so you can fork and modify to your heart's contents. And other details on how to use are also there.

** Onegai Translation Tools
Link: [[https://github.com/Atreyagaurav/onegai]]

Collection of some tools for translation from japanese to english. The tool can download novels from shosetsu website, preprocess them, translate them and combine them into html for bilingual reading.

** Clipboard Capture
Link: https://github.com/Atreyagaurav/clipcap

This tool just monitors your clipboard and captures the contents you're interested in. Useful when you have to copy multiple lines from a website without having to copy paste each one of them in a file.

** Birthday reminder
This one program was created to remind myself of the birthdays that I might miss.
This works for any annually celebrated dates, be it xmas or marriage anniversary too. But they have to be celebrated on a fixed date. 

I know there are like hundreds of programs which can remind you of the dates, but why is this special? 
- First it supports Bikram Sambhat (BS) date system. It might not be important for other people but since I'm from Nepal, I needed a program to do that in BS system as well as AD, and that's the reason I made this program.
- Second, it's a simple C program, and output is simple, so you can use this in scripts to make other pipelines. For example, I use the output produced by this program to display the birthdays in my desktop. 
- It supports output to remind formatted reminders. [[https://dianne.skoll.ca/projects/remind/][Remind]] is a CLI program that has its own syntax for making reminder entries. It is really sophisticated.


** Calendar desktop
Link: https://github.com/Atreyagaurav/calendar-desktop

This is a simple program that just prints out the current month's calendar dates for display from conky.

It is just cute enough for me and does the job without having to open any calendar app so I'm satisfied.

Here is the screenshot showing it in my desktop.

[[./images/calendar.png]]

For complicated calendar view with my reminder entries I use ~remind -c~.

** Time Counter
Link: https://github.com/Atreyagaurav/TimeCounter

This is a program in C# that I made during my GRE preparation days, I made it so I could have a countdown to my GRE exam, but it can be used to countdown anything. I made it remember the date set when I was using windows, but recently I tried and saw mono can run it in linux but the save doesn't work, so I made it countdown to end of day by default.

Here's a screenshot:

[[./images/timecounter.png]]

You can read through the readme in the repo to learn more.

** Anime shell
Link: https://github.com/Atreyagaurav/anime-helper-shell

This is basically an interactive shell for watching, tracking and everything anime related. Instead of just using a cli tool I found a whole shell was easier to use as you'd also have the autocompletion of anime names and episodes that way. Problem is I'm not good with networks so I can't understand how websites stream their videos. So sometimes it cannot do the direct streams, but other functionality are always there.

** Jisho Chibi
Link: https://github.com/Atreyagaurav/jisho-chibi

This is a small Qt application that acts as front end for jisho.org website for me to look at japanese words and their meanings while doing translations or reading japanese text.

** Gate Simulator
Another C program. This was me just passing time because I wanted to play around with simulation. But didn't end up as I thought. But as for simulation of electronic gate, I am proud of my file parsing and the calculations for the gates circuit. 

** Calculate Primes
This is a library I created for python. The core codes are on C, and I can generate a python module with setup.py.

The advantage is, this program can generate prime numbers and then cache them in a file, then you can read the file for the prime numbers, which makes it a lot faster than other simple program. The algorithm used to generate the prime number in itself is fast too.

** Scenatio Game
Link: https://github.com/Atreyagaurav/scenario-game

My try on making VN like text adventuring game.

* Linux specific scripts

** General scripts collection
Link: https://github.com/Atreyagaurav/scripts

I have a repository dedicated to linux scripts that I use. It has few of my favourites like compile script for LaTeX which auto detects changes in the ~.tex~ files and compiles them. Combined with auto-refresh on the viewer I can have realtime feedback.

And some general purposes like sound, brightness change, microphone mute etc scripts.

** Mtl related scripts
Link: https://github.com/Atreyagaurav/mtl-related-scripts

This repo has scripts that can be used for mtl and preprocessing of japanese text for mtl generation.

* Emacs specific codes

** LiTeX mode
Link: https://github.com/Atreyagaurav/litex-mode

This repo is a minor mode for text modes in emacs, it can convert valid lisp expressions to latex ones, so that you can use lisp for calculations and turn them into latex for exports.

** Units Mode
Link: [[https://github.com/Atreyagaurav/units-mode]]

After finding about gnu units with superb capacity to convert between units as well as to do units related calculations, I made an emacs interface to it. Now I can use it from inside emacs and I also added some extra functionality like molecular weight calculations. It was a fun short project.

** flite mode
Link: https://github.com/Atreyagaurav/flite-minor-mode

This is a minor mode to use on text modes that implements Text to Speech (TTS) using flite. So I can make emacs read me contents. Though using flite I can read any text on my laptop as long as it's on screen as text. Using emacs means I can have it highlight lines it's reading to keep track of where it is.

** other modes
Other modes that I wrote for emacs that I didn't make into individual repository are here: https://github.com/Atreyagaurav/emacs-modules


* LaTeX class

** University Submission and Homeworks
Link: https://github.com/Atreyagaurav/university-report-class

This repository has two classes ~unisubmission~ and ~unihw~ that I use for my submissions. Combining this with org settings I have automated the task enough that for simple submission I can just export an emacs org file and submit it.

* Term Projects

** Fall 2022

*** Aquifer Properties Parameter estimation using Genetic algorithm
Link: https://github.com/Atreyagaurav/aquifer-properties-ga

This is a term project for optimization problem where I did a parameter estimation for groundwater data. I used Genetic Algorithm to do the job since I've been meaning to try it. It was fun.

The readme in the repo has the animation with the final results and how the solution converse.

** Spring 2022

*** Ground Water Models in flopy
Link: https://github.com/Atreyagaurav/GroundWaterModeling

This repo has the groundwater modeling I did for my groundwater modeling class during spring 2022, it has org files with description and python codes using the flopy library to make MODFLOW models and execute them. The releases tag has the jupyter notebooks for people who use it. Everything else like py, latex and pdf in the repo can be generated from the org file itself. As well as the org files can be directly browsed in the github without having to download them.
