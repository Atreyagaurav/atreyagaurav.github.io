<p>
Hi there.
</p>

<p>
I'm a Linux Enthusiast, so I write a lot of scripts or codes for personal linux tools, and I write some for emacs.
</p>

<p>
My research area is Hydrology/Hydraulics. I'd be happy to collaborate on things related to those.
</p>

<p>
My hobbies include anime and light novels, so I sometimes contribute to fan translations by making scripts or proof reading. Or very rarely trying to translate using meager japanese that I know (and lots of jisho/deepl).
</p>

<p>
You can reach me in discord, my username is: thevoidzero#４６８６ (type it out, don't copy it)

I don't like web dev that much because I find it harder than making software tools. But since web apps are lot easier to use and easier to update after distribution I do make some. But unfortunately I haven't made anything that has lots of users/visitors.

This is a project I did as a ORISE Fellow. Here the extreme precipitation analysis was done for the whole continental United States based on HUC regions, and the spatial patterns were clustered.

It is currently under developement, the plan is to make a platform where translations can be done by the translators while the users can also read the content in both languages line by line. The website is intended to be used by language learners who are interested in literatures.
</p>

<p>
Due to my lack of skill in web dev, the website is just a skeleton for now. I do have a local copy with backend but I don't yet know the proper way to host it.
</p>

<p>
And because of lack of skill I've made a <a href="https://github.com/Atreyagaurav/onegai">commandline tool</a> in Rust for some translation works.

<p>
This one program was created to remind myself of the birthdays that I might miss.
This works for any annually celebrated dates, be it xmas or marriage anniversary too. But they have to be celebrated on a fixed date. 
</p>

<p>
I know there are like hundreds of programs which can remind you of the dates, but why is this special? 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>First it supports Bikram Sambhat (BS) date system. It might not be important for other people but since I'm from Nepal, I needed a program to do that in BS system as well as AD, and that's the reason I made this program.</li>
<li>Second, it's a simple C program, and output is simple, so you can use this in scripts to make other pipelines. For example, I use the output produced by this program to display the birthdays in my desktop.</li>
<li>It supports output to remind formatted reminders. <a href="https://dianne.skoll.ca/projects/remind/">Remind</a> is a CLI program that has its own syntax for making reminder entries. It is really sophisticated.</li>

This is basically an interactive shell for watching, tracking and everything anime related. Instead of just using a cli tool I found a whole shell was easier to use as you'd also have the autocompletion of anime names and episodes that way. Problem is I'm not good with networks so I can't understand how websites stream their videos. So sometimes it cannot do the direct streams, but other functionality are always there.

This repository has two classes <code>unisubmission</code> and <code>unihw</code> that I use for my submissions. Combining this with org settings I have automated the task enough that for simple submission I can just export an emacs org file and submit it.

This is a term project for optimization problem where I did a parameter estimation for groundwater data. I used Genetic Algorithm to do the job since I've been meaning to try it. It was fun.

The readme in the repo has the animation with the final results and how the solution converse.

<p>
This repo has the groundwater modeling I did for my groundwater modeling class during spring 2022, it has org files with description and python codes using the flopy library to make MODFLOW models and execute them. The releases tag has the jupyter notebooks for people who use it. Everything else like py, latex and pdf in the repo can be generated from the org file itself. As well as the org files can be directly browsed in the github without having to download them.
